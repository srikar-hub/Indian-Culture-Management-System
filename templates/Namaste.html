        <p>In Indian culture, greeting rituals often involve joining palms together 
        in front of the chest and bowing slightly, known as "Namaste." This gesture 
        is accompanied by saying "Namaste" or "Namaskar," which means "I bow to the 
        divine in you." It is a sign of respect and acknowledgment of the divine 
        presence within each individual. In addition to Namaste, other forms of 
        greeting may include touching the feet of elders as a sign of respect, or 
        simply exchanging verbal greetings such as "hello" or "good morning." Greeting 
        rituals vary across regions and communities in India, but the underlying principles 
        of respect, humility, and acknowledging the divine in others remain consistent.</p><br>
