    <p>In Hinduism, the cow holds a sacred status, revered as a symbol of purity, motherhood, and non-violence. The significance of the cow dates back thousands of years, rooted in ancient Vedic texts where it is often referred to as "go-mata," meaning mother cow. The cow is seen as a provider of nourishment, sustenance, and even spiritual upliftment, as its milk, ghee (clarified butter), and dung hold symbolic and practical importance.</p>

    <h1 data-splitting>The Management of Holy Cows</h1>
    <p>Given its revered status, the management of holy cows presents both challenges and opportunities. In rural areas, cows are often regarded as members of the family, cared for with love and devotion. However, rapid urbanization and modernization have led to new challenges, such as stray cattle on streets, conflicts over grazing land, and issues related to animal welfare.
      </p>
    <p>
     Efforts are underway to address these challenges through various initiatives. Cow shelters, known as "gaushalas," have been established across the country to provide care and protection to abandoned and stray cows. Additionally, campaigns promoting the adoption of indigenous cattle breeds and sustainable dairy practices aim to preserve traditional knowledge and support rural livelihoods.</p>
